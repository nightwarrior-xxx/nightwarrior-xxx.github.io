Now to keep that data secure and safe you need to need to keep it somewhere where no one can harm it. So, if you are thinking to keep your database on cloud then you are thinking correct.

You will need a medium or an external service to upload that data to cloud. These tools are called linked service.</li>\n<li>activities\nPerforming some action on data stored is known as activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Data Lakes</h2>\n<p>Data Lakes perform two-in-one task.
